    <h2>Description</h3>
    <p>Cherries jubilee is a refreshing dessert, especially after a hearty meal. This does have to be prepared immediately before serving, but does not take a lot of time. Your guests will enjoy the blue flames when the brandy is ignited!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>¼ cup cold water</li>
        <li>¼ cup orange juice</li>
        <li>1 pound Bing or other dark, sweet cherries, rinsed and pitted (or use frozen pitted cherries)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon finely grated orange zest</li>
        <li>3 cups vanilla bean ice cream</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cherry extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup brandy</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk sugar and cornstarch together in a wide saucepan. Stir in water and orange juice; bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking until thickened.
